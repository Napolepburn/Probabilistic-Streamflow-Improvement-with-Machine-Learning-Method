# Probabilistic-Streamflow-Improvement-with-Machine-Learning-Method


Brief Description:

1. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was used to implement monthly probabilistic streamflow prediction, based on more than 50 years of historical runoff records, point precipitation, climate phenomenon indices and the lead-time information of predictors. 

2. The à-trous-wavelet-based direct (DF) and multi-component (MF) methods were used to improve the performance of simple ELM.


Capture 1. 19 climate phenomenon indices, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA-ESRL) (https://psl.noaa.gov/data/climateindices/list/), were selected as potential inputs.

Capture 3. The multi-component wavelet-based method was able to greatly improve the forecast sharpness.
